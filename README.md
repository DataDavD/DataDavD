### üëã Hey there friend!!! My name is **David Dansby**. Sometimes I go by DataDavd or datadavd online (a relic from data engineering days). I am a self-taught software engineer at Atlassian working to ensure Bitbucket data is secure. I have a strong passion for secure data processing systems, Go, Python, and limited single-origin coffees. When time allows you can find me tinkering with one of my split mechanical keyboards. Given I just bought a house, I‚Äôve recently been getting into home automation (Alexa-based); ask about my 40+ smart home devices I have connected.

### üí™ I‚Äôm currently working remotely at Atlassian as a Backend Software Engineer on Jira Align. Previously, I worked on the Bitbucket Cloud Data Privacy and Security team. And before that, I was a data engineer on the Data Analytics and Engineering team at Atlassian that owned the core data pipelines (we typically ingested 500GB+ of data each day into our pipelines; and processed even more!!!). 

### :mount_fuji: I'm located in the greater Seattle area; beautiful Edmonds to be specific.

### üíª Outside of work I'm constantly learning and improving my skills. Currently, I've been heavily using ChatGPT, Copilot, Bard, and Claude 2.0 to enhance both my software engineering skillset, work efficiency, and overall life productivity, on top of continuing to learn more about distributed systems, and strengthening my API development skills. 

### üìö Outside of software engineering and tech, I'v been diligently learning and mastering French to deepen my understanding of my wife's culture, and enhance my communication with my wife's family and friends. And, since I've moved to Seattle last year, I've been snowboarding and hiking with my brother now that I'm closer to him. When possible, I love using travel points to fly business/first class around the world with my better half, my amazing wife.

### ‚å®Ô∏è I am currently using a [Boardsource lulu](https://boardsource.xyz/store/61d0b772319a1f3cc53ba2fb) with Alpaca V2 linear switches lubed with 205g0 and official Star Wars Galatic Empire DSA keycaps from [NovelKeys](https://novelkeys.com/products/star-wars-galactic-empire-dsa-keycap-set) as my daily driver. What does it look like? [Find out](https://imgur.com/a/aZB5aaT)!
