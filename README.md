### 👋 Hey there friend, my name is **David Dansby**. Sometimes I go by DataDavd or datadavd online. I am an autodidactic (i.e. self-taught) software engineer at Atlassian working to ensure Bitbucket data is secure. I have a strong passion for secure data processing systems, Python, Go, mechanical keyboards, and rare single-origin coffee brewed using simple pour-over methods.

### 💪 I’m currently working at Atlassian as a Backend Software Engineer on the Bitbucket Data Privacy and Security team. Previously, I was a data engineer on the Data Analytics and Engineering team at Atlassian that owned the data pipeline that ingests 500GB+ of data each day into our core data pipelines. 

### :computer: Since I just started on a new team I may not be as active on GitHub for the next couple months as I move fast to get up to speed with my new team's projects, tooling, and processes

### 🌉 I live in one of the greatest places on earth for lovers of tech and software, Silicon Valley, California

### 🌱 Outside of work I'm constantly learning and improving my skills. Currently, I'm focused on mastering Go, learning more about distributed systems theory and applications, and strengthening my API development skills. When I get time I like to build new mechanical keyboards or tweak my daily driver (i.e. lube switches, spring swap, etc.). Sometimes, I go hiking and snowboarding. When possible, I love using travel points to fly business/first class around the world with my lovely wife.
