### 👋 Hey there friend, my name is **David Dansby**. Sometimes I go by DataDavd or datadavd online. I am an autodidactic (i.e. self-taught) software engineer at Atlassian working to ensure Bitbucket data is secure. I have a strong passion for secure data processing systems, Python, Go, mechanical keyboards, and rare single-origin coffee brewed using simple pour-over methods.

### 💪 I’m currently working at Atlassian as a Backend Software Engineer on the Bitbucket Data Privacy and Security team. Previously, I was a data engineer on the Data Analytics and Engineering team at Atlassian that owned the core data pipelines (we typically ingested 500GB+ of data each day into our pipelines; and processed even more!!!). 

### 🌉 I live in one of the greatest places on earth for lovers of tech and software: Silicon Valley, California.

### 🌱 Outside of work I'm constantly learning and improving my skills. Currently, I'm focused on mastering Go, learning more about distributed systems theory and applications, and strengthening my API development skills. When I get time I like to build new mechanical keyboards or tweak my daily driver (i.e. lube switches, spring swap, etc.). Sometimes, I go hiking and snowboarding. When possible, I love using travel points to fly business/first class around the world with my better half, my amazing, lovely wife.

- [v0.54.0](https://github.com/treeverse/lakeFS/releases/tag/v0.54.0): Added in-app lakeFS documentation links on the Setup, Create a Repository (Modal), Branches, and Auth/Admin pages of lakeFS UI. For reference, the PR is [Pull Request #2506](https://github.com/treeverse/lakeFS/pull/2506)

[go-bitbucket](https://github.com/ktrysmt/go-bitbucket)
- [v0.9.21](https://github.com/ktrysmt/go-bitbucket/releases/tag/v0.9.21): Added Diff-Stat functionality. For reference, the PR is [Pull Request #145](https://github.com/ktrysmt/go-bitbucket/pull/145)
- [v0.9.24](https://github.com/ktrysmt/go-bitbucket/releases/tag/v0.9.24): Created RepositoryRefsOptions type and ListRefs method. For reference, the PR is [Pull Request #155](https://github.com/ktrysmt/go-bitbucket/pull/155)
- [v0.9.30](https://github.com/ktrysmt/go-bitbucket/releases/tag/v0.9.30): Update GetDiffStat functionality to filter response fields. For reference, the PR is [Pull Request #171](https://github.com/ktrysmt/go-bitbucket/pull/171)
- [Pull Request #156](https://github.com/ktrysmt/go-bitbucket/pull/156): This PR simplifies TagOptions and BranchOptions types into a single RefOptions type (since git tags and branches are both refs) and adds DeleteBranch and DeleteTag functionality. This PR has not been merged yet as it is part of a large set of workstreams that encompass breaking changes in order to simplify the API by removing branch and tag specific options and moving to a single refs options (see [Issue #153](https://github.com/ktrysmt/go-bitbucket/issues/153))
